# LED-Emergency-Light-Simulation-Using-Ultrasound-Sensor

In this project, it is created a ROS Range publisher node to publish the ultrasound sensor reading, and accordingly the distance between the object and the
ultrasound sensor, we turn on/off a LED, making this way a simple simulation of a LED emergency light.
